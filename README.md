# FIFA-2018-stats-dashboard
testing matplotlib graphing functions with FIFA 2018 player data

Using data from 'fifa_data.csv', I tested several graphing functions
offered by the Python library 'matplotlib.pyplot'

Files included are:
-The data
-The scripts to generate the graphs as '*.png' files
-A script to output the data onto a dashboard '.pdf' file
